Python script that determines is a given data set

Return True if valid, False otherwise.

def validUTF8(data):
    """ Determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
      For each byte:
      If num_bytes is 0, it means we're starting a new UTF-8 character.
      We need to determine how many bytes this character will have:
        If the byte starts with 110, it's a 2-byte character.
        If it starts with 1110, it's a 3-byte character.
        If it starts with 11110, it's a 4-byte character.
        If it starts with 0 (in the most significant bit),
          it's a single-byte character.
        If none of these conditions are met,
          it's an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence so we return False.
      If num_bytes is not 0, it means we're in the middle of a
        multi-byte character, and the current byte should start with 10.
      If it doesn't, it's invalid, so we return False.
      After processing each byte, if there are still bytes left in the
        current multi-byte character (i.e., num_bytes is not 0), it means the
        input data is incomplete and therefore invalid.
      If all bytes are processed without encountering any issues,
        and there are no trailing bytes from incomplete multi-byte characters,
        we return True, indicating that the input data
        is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
